### Step 1: Choose a Testing Framework

Choose a testing framework for your project. Popular options for JavaScript include Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, and Karma. For this example, let's use Jest.

### Step 2: Set Up Jest and Write Tests

​
Install Jest and any necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

​
Configure Jest by creating a `jest.config.js` file and specifying the test environment and any other configurations:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
    testEnvironment: "node",
};
```

​
Write your unit tests in a `__tests__` directory or with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extension alongside your source code.

### Step 3: Run Tests Locally

Run your tests locally to ensure they pass:

```bash
npx jest
```

### Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one.

### Step 5: Push Code to GitHub

Push your code, including the test files, to your GitHub repository.

### Step 6: Configure GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration

Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository and add a YAML file, e.g., `ci.yml`. Configure GitHub Actions to run your tests on each push:

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches:
main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
​
name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '16'
​
name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
​
name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```

### Step 7: Commit and Push GitHub Actions Configuration

Commit and push the GitHub Actions configuration file (`ci.yml`) to your repository.
